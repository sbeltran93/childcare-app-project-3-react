# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


My project 3 app is a childcare application. The purpose and functionality of my app is to first, create an account, sign in. You hit the landing page and there is a nav bar to explore to your home page which is the dashboard, a page to add a child, a page to add a post to the class newsfeed, and to signout. on the home/dashboard page you can see all of your account information and also the children you have added for childcare and their information. You can also edit or delete your account information and your childs information. You can also go to the Class feed page where you can see posts posted by users about how a day in class has gone or any important information.
